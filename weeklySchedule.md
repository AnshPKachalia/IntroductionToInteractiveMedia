### This document: Weekly Schedule

This includes:
- Weekly topic(s)
- Production assignments
- Reading assignments
- Projects


This is all subject to change

### Week 1 (Sept. 8 & 10)

Primitive shapes, Programming concepts

#### Assignments Due September 15

Email Assignment:

- Email me a link to your github repository

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Getting Started with
	Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate systems and
	space](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing)

Production Assignment:

- Make a self portrait using Processing.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named 
````September15````
	- Upload your program into the new folder, 
	with the extension ````.pde````. 
		- Use **COMMAND T** or **CONTROL T** to indent your code properly
		- Your program should be well commented and organized. 
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a ````README.md```` in the new folder and include 
	your screenshot in the ````README.md````.
	- Write a very simple description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.

### Week 2 (September 15 and 17)

Production Assignment:

- Using loops (````for()```` or ````while()````) in some way, 
along with everything that you've learned so far, 
make a simple work of art. 
You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, 
but you don't need to make your so elaborate. 
Scroll through and look for images:

## Fall Break-ish October 20-22

### Week 7 (October 27 and 29)

Midterm Critique; Introduction to Electricity and Arduino Digital Input and Output

### Note that although October 29 is the Prophet’s Birthday Holiday classes will meet as scheduled

#### Assignments Due October 29

Reading Assignment:

- Sparkfun [breadboard
	tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/digital-input-output/)

Production Assignment:

- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires with a very tight ziptie 
	that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because 
	it may take you a while to find the right tool. 
	A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires 
	and hurt you.

![](media/jumpersWithCableTieRemoved.jpg)

- **Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!**

#### Assignments due November 3

Reading Assignment:

- [Physical Computing’s Greatest hits and
	misses](http://www.tigoe.net/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/) and

	three LEDs, create a puzzle that can be solved by pressing the buttons.
	Each switch must not simply turn on a corresponding LED.

- Document your project as before
	- Github folder called ````November3````
		- Schematic 
			- Can be either hand or computer drawn

	- Have your browser open to your video
- Create a new folder in your github repository called ````November10````
- Describe your project in README.md and include:
	- A description of your concept and how it was achieved
	- A picture of your circuit schematic  
	- A photograph of your project
