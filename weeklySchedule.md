### This document: Weekly Schedule

This includes:
- Weekly topic(s)
- Production assignments
- Reading assignments
- Projects

### Week 1 (May 24 - May 27)

Primitive shapes, Programming concepts, Animation, Conditionals, Loops

#### Assignments Due May 26

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Getting Started with
	Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate systems and
	space](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing)

Email Assignment:

- Email me a link to your Github repository

Production Assignment:

- Make a self portrait using Processing.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named 
`May26`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, 
	with the extension ````.pde````. 
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a ````README.md```` in the new folder and include 
	your screenshot in the ````README.md````.
	- Write a very simple description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.

#### Assignments Due May 27 

Reading Assignment:

- If you are new to functions or want to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.
- Watch at least the first four of Dan shiffman's [Object Oriented
	Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcbcfkLzgvs&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bb7z2IJaTlzwzIg_5yvL4i)
	tutorials.

Production Assignment:

- Using loops (`for()` or `while()`) in some way, 
along with everything that you've learned so far, 
make a simple work of art. 
You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, 
but you don't need to make your so elaborate. 
Scroll through and look for images:

- In your Github repository, create a new folder named 
`May27`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, 
	with the extension `.pde`. 
	- Use **COMMAND T** or **CONTROL T** to indent your code properly
	- Your program should be well commented and organized. 
	- Excellent names for variables
	- Excellent names for functions, if you make any
	- Upload a screenshot of your artwork into the new folder
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include

a new artwork/game. 
Since you only have one day, very simple assignments are acceptable.
If your last assignment already used Object Oriented Programming
you don't need to submit a new assignment, but do make a folder
and describe in the README.md how you used Classes.
Pay attention to the structure, clarity, and organization of your program. 
As always, document your project:
	- New Github folder named **the date the assignment is due**
	- Well commented code, especially
	for any confusing or tricky parts 
	- References to any examples or inspiration
	- Functions as needed to organize your program
	- Excellent names for classes, objects, variables, and functions

	- Manipulate the pixels array in some intentional way 
		(intentional so that you will know if it's working the way you want it to)
	- Display the `pixels` array on your canvas using `updatePixels()`
- Bring an idea (or ideas) to class for your midterm, described below. You may
	change your idea as you work on it, but I want you to have some idea to
	start with on Monday.

Midterm project due on June 14:

Make a game using everything you have learned so far
- The game can be for one or more players
- The game must not be a shooting game (down with violence!)
- The game must include
	- At least one shape
	- At least one image
	- At least one sound
	- At least one on-screen text
- The game must start with a screen giving instructions, and must wait there 
until a button or key (your choice) is pressed
- After the game is won or lost, there must be a way to restart the game
**without closing and restarting the program**

#### Assignments Due June ?:

Production Assignment:

- Make some progress on you midterm project
Document in a new folder called ````midtermProject````
- In that folder create a new file called journal.md.
Start with a preliminary description of what
you intend for your project, followed by
a journal of your progress. Each day add the date
and then describe the work you plan to do or did that day.
Include you thoughts, decisions, experiments, etc.
Discuss what worked and what didn't
At the end of each journal entry, describe whether, 
and if so, how, the results of today's work
has caused you to modify your plan for your midterm project.

Reading Assignment:


#### Assignments Due June 10

Production Assignment :

**Finish your midterm project**

Documentation:
- README.md to include 
	- At least everything we have included up to now
	- Clear instructions for playing the game
	- Screen shots of different game stages
	- Description of major problems and modifications you made to overcome them
- Program to include
	- At least everything we have included up to now
	- Your name and assignment due date
	- Well commented code, especially for any confusing or tricky parts 


#### Assignments Due June 14

Reading Assignment:

- Sparkfun [breadboard
	tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/digital-input-output/)

Production Assignment:

- You will need a USB-A port. If you have a modern laptop with only USB-C
	ports, you will need to borrow (from Academic Tech if you are on campus) or
	buy (if you are off-campus) a USB-A to USB-C adapter.
- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires with a very tight ziptie 
	that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because 
	it may take you a while to find the right tool. 
	A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires 
	and hurt you.

![](media/jumpersWithCableTieRemoved.jpg)

- **Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!**

### Week 4 (June 14 - 17)

and at least one digital sensor (switch), 
and use this information to control at least two LEDs,
