- Reading assignments
- Projects

### Week 1 (Jan 19, 21)

Primitive shapes, Programming concepts

#### Assignments Due January 21

Reading Assignment:

- Email me a link to your Github repository

Reading Assignment:

Production Assignment:

- Make a self portrait using Processing.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named 
`January26`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, 
	with the extension ````.pde````. 
		- Use **COMMAND T** or **CONTROL T** to indent your code properly
		- Your program should be well commented and organized. 
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a ````README.md```` in the new folder and include 
	your screenshot in the ````README.md````.
	- Write a very simple description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.

and then describe the work you plan to do or did that day.
Include you thoughts, decisions, experiments, etc.
Discuss what worked and what didn't
At the end of each journal entry, describe whether, 
and if so, how, the results of today's work
has caused you to modify your plan for your midterm project.

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things, The Psychopathology of Everyday Things](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~mboyle/COGS1/readings/Norman-COGS1-The%20Psychopathology-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)

### Week 7 (March 2, 4)

Midterm Critique

#### Assignments Due March 18

Reading Assignment:

- Sparkfun [breadboard
	tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/digital-input-output/)

Production Assignment:

- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires with a very tight ziptie 
	that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because 
	it may take you a while to find the right tool. 
	A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires 
	and hurt you.

![](media/jumpersWithCableTieRemoved.jpg)

- **Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!**

### Week 8 (March 19, 21)

Introduction to Electricity and Arduino Digital Input and Output
