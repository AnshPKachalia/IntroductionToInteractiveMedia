### September 10 2020

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- You may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

**Processing**

#### Simple shapes

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `size()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `color()`
- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, PI, CHORD)`
- `random()`

Confused? 
- Google
- Processing reference page

#### Variables
- `int myNumber = 45;`
- `int myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `int myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
- Other variable types. `int` is by far most common, another common is `float`
- Built-in variables
	- `width`, `height`
	- many others

Here is an example Processing program (also called a 'sketch') 

````
size(400, 400);
ellipse(width/2, height/2, 50, 50);

/*
stroke(0,255,0);
fill(255,0,0);
//ellipse(100,100, 50, 50);

fill(255,0,0, 30);
//rect(30, 30, 50, 80);


// Now I will try to draw an arc
//arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD);

// pick a random number up to 180
float myRandomArcSize = random(180);
int arcSizeAsInt = round (myRandomArcSize);
println(myRandomArcSize + "   " + arcSizeAsInt);

// convert that number to radians
float arcSizeInRadians = radians(myRandomArcSize);

print(myRandomArcSize + "    " + arcSizeInRadians);

// draw the arc
arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, arcSizeInRadians, CHORD);
*/
````


Time permitting, go further
	
#### Animation
- `draw()`
- `setup()`

````
int foo = 0;

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

`background()`

`frameRate()`

Yesterday we were able to draw without using `setup()` and `draw()`. What's
the difference?

Static vs. active mode

#### Interaction with Processing

- conditionals

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed == true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Important concepts**:
1. `mousePressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mousePressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

- Two more interesting built-in variables: `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- Using the cursor to draw
	- Now use a mouse click to clear the screen
	- (Time permitting, primitive painting program)

#### Loops
`while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  int foo = 50;

  while (foo < width) {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    foo = foo + 50;
  }
}
````
You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables. What
is a better name for the variable foo?

### September 15 2020

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- Once connected you may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

#### Portraits

Look at some portraits. Ask if you want to know how something was
accomplished.

#### Review

- ````setup()```` and ````draw()````
- ````background()````
- Conditional statements using ````if()````
- Loops using ````while()````

#### ````for()```` loops

````for```` is very similar to ````while()```` but combines three steps in
one:

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  for (int foo = 50;foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

	- Once connected you may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time
- **Record Zoom!**
- Discussion leading rubric
	- Review instructions for [student-led
		discussion](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/syllabus.md#student-led-discussions)

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names , good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse
- Clarity (remember the three reasons for clarity: yourself, sharing,
	grading)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

Review basics of functions from last week

#### Variable Scope

````
int foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions
void setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

void draw() {

  println(foo);

  int bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (int i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

In class exercise:

1. Write a function that will take a single parameter
and draw a vertical line from the top of the canvas to the bottom
at the X coordinate indicated by the parameter
	1. In the ````draw()```` function test this function 
	at a couple of different locations
1. Write another function that will draw a **horizontal** line
at the indicated **Y** coordinate
	1. Test as before
1. Using these two functions, write a program in ````draw()````
that draws a grid of lines at regular intervals on the canvas

Discussion:

- What debugging methods helped you find and fix problems?
- What other functions might be useful?
- What other parameters might be useful?

Here is the program that Shaurya developed:

````
void setup() { 
  size(500, 500); 
  background(255);
} 

void draw() { 
  vlineMaker(0, 50); 
  hlineMaker(0, 50);
} 

void vlineMaker(int x, int xstep) { 
  while (x<width) { 
    line(x, 0, x, height); 
    x = x+xstep;
  }
} 

void hlineMaker(int y, int ystep) { 
  while (y<height) { 
    line(0, y, width, y); 
    y = y+ystep;
  }
}
````

#### Motion

Let us use make a ball bounce on the floor. First, make a circle move:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;
}
</pre>

Now, make it change directions when it hits the floor:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = -speed;
  }
}
</pre>

Now, do two thing: 1) use gravity to increase its speed as it falls and 2) reduce its speed on each bounce:

<pre>

float gravity = .1;
float speed = 0;
float x = 320;
float y = 0;

void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
} 

void draw() {
  background(150);
  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  speed+=gravity;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = 0.95 * speed; // this slows the acceleration
    speed = -speed; // this reverses
  }
}
</pre>

Discussion:

- What functions might be useful here?
- How can we use the `random()` function to make things more interesting?
- What about multiple bouncing balls?

#### Arrays 
<pre>
final int numberOfValues = 10;

int[] values = new int[numberOfValues];

int n = 0;
while (n < values.length) {
  values[n] = (n+1) * (n+1);
  n = n + 1;
}

for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
  println(values[i]);
}
</pre>

**Things to notice**

- Just like functions are signified by `()`, arrays are signified by `[]`
- Arrays can be of any data type, but can't be mixed types
- `final` keyword
- `new` keyword
- Why not just use ten "normal" variables?
- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you use an array, you probably want a loop.

#### How to add more examples into Processing

For example, from Dan Shiffman's book *Learning Processing*

1. File -> Examples -> Add Examples
1. type `learning processing` in the search box
1. select the one we want

Now you can see all examples from the book 

1. File -> Examples -> Contributed Examples

The examples are also online [here](http://learningprocessing.com/examples)

#### Review arrays

A more advanced array example, and introduction to the very useful `map()`
function:

<pre>
float[] coswave; 

void setup() {
  size(900, 300);
  
  coswave = new float[width];
  for (int xPosition = 0; xPosition < width; xPosition++) {
    coswave[xPosition] = cos(radians(xPosition));
  }
  background(255);
  noLoop();
}

void draw() {
  for (int xPosition = 0; xPosition < width; xPosition++) {
    float waveHeight = map(coswave[xPosition], -1, 1, 0, height);
    point(xPosition, waveHeight);
  }
}
</pre>

**Remember**

- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you use an array, you probably want a loop.

**Things to notice**

* In the array example on Tuesday, 
I created the variable that would store the
array, and created the ten `int`s, all in one line. This time,
I created the variable that would store the array globally, 
and then I created the `float` variables inside of `setup()`.
Either way works; sometimes you will find you have to do it one
way or the other, but for the most part it's your choice.
* I used `noLoop()` because this only needed to run once. In fact
I didn't even need to use `draw()`, 
I could have put all the action into `setup()`
* How did I get the height of the wave to perfectly fit the height?
Practice using the `map()` function, it is incredibly useful
and works in Arduino also exactly the same way.

#### Classes

[this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/simpleProcessingClassExample)

#### Text

<pre>
String message= "Important message";

void setup() {
  size(640, 360);

  // What fonts are available?
  // String[] fontList = PFont.list();
  // printArray(fontList);

  PFont f = createFont("monaco", 32);
  textFont(f, 32);
  color myFavoriteColor =color(255, 0, 0);

  fill(myFavoriteColor);
  textAlign(CENTER);
  text(message, width/2, height/2);
}
</pre>

**Things to notice**

* New datatype called `PFont`
* New datatype called `color`
* `fill()` and `textAlign()` will apply to any further texts or shapes until
they are changed

Some advanced examples using text are
[here](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/tree/master/processingExamples)


#### Perlin Noise

````
void draw() {
  background(204);
  float n = random(0, width);
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

What if we wanted the line to move in a more organic, lifelike
fashion? Organic things (e.g. butterflys, leaves blowing in the wind, clouds) 
don't jump instantly from one place to another,
they tend to move close to where they were last time

````
float offset = 0.0;

void draw() {
  background(204);
  offset = offset + .01;
  float n = noise(offset) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

Things to notice:

* Why is the variable `offset` global? (Remember our discussion of variable
	scope)

#### Events

````
final int maxColors = 10;
color[] myColors = new color[maxColors];

int colorChoice = 0;

void setup() {
  size(600, 500);

  for (int i = 0; i < myColors.length; i ++ ) {
    myColors[i]=color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  }
}

void draw() {
}

void mousePressed() {
  background(myColors[colorChoice]);
  colorChoice ++;
}
````

Things to notice:

* How does the background change if I never call `mousePressed()`?
`mousePressed()` is a *callback function*, meaning we have told
Processing that we are interested in this event, and if it occurs,
call this function. There are many different types of events available in
Processing, and you register an interest in them by creating a callback
function with the appropriate name. See *mouse* and *keyboard* 
in the Processing Reference Page.

* What happens if I click the mouse more than 10 times?

<strong>Where to find data</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Sources
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/">https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/</a></li>

 	<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Source</a> of datasets from Alia</li>
	<li>Also look at examples from last spring. You can see their Github
	repositories <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/abudhabi_im_intro/student-github-repositories/">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Format
<ul>
 	<li>CSV</li>
 	<li>Can use a spreadsheet program to open data from many formats and then save as CSV</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

##### How to process CSV files

Examples from Aaron Sherwood’s Introduction to Interactive Media <a href="https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media">Github repository</a>
<ul>
 	<li>load/split strings: splitCommas.pde</li>
 	<li>load save table: tableSaveLoad.pde</li>
 	<li>forces: lettersGravityWind.pde</li>
</ul>

##### JSON: Another data format

JSON is another format for organizing data in a file. It is more complex than CSV, and again Processing provides functions for parsing JSON

<a href="https://processing.org/examples/loadsavejson.html">https://processing.org/examples/loadsavejson.html</a>

If you want to learn more about JSON and also XML, 
which yet another data format, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqROpUNb2aY">here</a> 
is a good introductory video tutorial.

<h3>Generative Text</h3>
Pull words from a file (CSV or JSON), 
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever

#### Transformations

<ul>
 	<li>Transforms move the canvas so you can draw in different places with the same code</li>
 	<li>Available 2D transforms are `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()`. (Why the parenthesis?)</li>
 	<li>pushMatrix() and popMatrix() allow you to remember where the canvas was, and then return to it's last position</li>
</ul>
Draw a house at a given location, no transform:
<pre>void house(int x, int y)
{
  triangle(x + 15, y, x, y + 15, x + 30, y + 15);
  rect(x, y + 15, 30, 30);
  rect(x + 12, y + 30, 10, 15);
}</pre>
Same result, but using a transform:
<pre>void house(int x, int y)
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
  popMatrix();
}
</pre>
</ul>

##### Rotation and scaling 

Work through <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/transform2d/">this</a> tutorial

#### Working with Images

[aiweiwei.jpg](media/aiweiwei.jpeg)

<strong>PImage</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Just another class, i.e. it has
<ul>
 	<li>Data (the pixels, width, height, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Functionality `(image()`, `get()`, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

````
PImage photo; 

void setup() { 
  size(700, 700); 
  photo = loadImage("/home/michael/tmp/intro/aiweiwei.jpeg");
} 

void draw() { 
  image(photo, 10, 10);
	// How do you suppose you might scale the image?
}
````

Things to notice

* Get familiar with the error *NullPointerException*
* If you do not specify a complete path Processing will look 
in the same folder as the sketch and
for a folder called *data* in the same folder as the sketch
(I'm not sure in what order)


`img.get(x,y)` - Gets the color of the pixel at this location

`img.get(x,y,w,h)` - Gets a portion of the image

````
PImage photo;

void setup() {
  photo = loadImage("/home/michael/tmp/intro/aiweiwei.jpeg");

  size(700, 700);

  image(photo, 10, 10);

  PImage newImage = photo.get(400, 550, 100, 100);

  image (newImage, 50, 50);
}
````

Also

````
image(photo, positionX, positionY, width, height);
tint(red, green, blue);
imageMode(CENTER);
````

Arrays of images

Example15-3: *Swappingimages* from Dan Shiffman's *Learning Processing* 


<strong>Pixels</strong>

You can access individual pixels 
from the canvas (and whatever is on the canvas)
using the special built-in array called ````pixels````. 
Before using it you must load images from the canvas into the ````pixels```` array ````usingloadPixels()````, 
and after making any changes you must call ````updatePixels()```` 
to write from the pixels array back to the canvas
if you want to make changes to the canvas

````
color pink = color(255, 102, 204);

loadPixels();

// change the first row to pink
for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
  pixels[i] = pink; 
}

updatePixels();
````

the pixels array is one-dimensional, 
meaning if you want to go to a different row on the canvas 
you need to offset by that many widths:

![](media/pixelarray2d.jpg)


````
color pink = color(255, 102, 204);

loadPixels();

// Change the fifth row to pink
for (int i = width*5; i < (width + width*5); i++) {
  pixels[i] = pink;
}

updatePixels();
````

It's important to remember that a pixel is just a color (red, green, blue).
Anything so you can manipulate pixels mathematically 
e.g. make it fade:

````
int r = 255;
int change = -1;
void setup() {
  size(500,500);
}

void draw() {

  color myColor = color(r, 102, 204);

  loadPixels();
  for (int i = 0; i < width * height; i++) {
    pixels[i] = myColor;
  }
  updatePixels();

  r -= change;

  if (r < 0 || r > 255) {
    change = -change;
  }
}

````

The ````pixels```` [data
type](https://processing.org/reference/color_datatype.html)

Some fun examples from Professor Sherwood:

![](media/circularImages.png)

````
PImage img;
PImage[] tiles;

int tileSize = 100;

void setup() {
  size (400,400);
  img = loadImage("/home/michael/tmp/intro/aiweiwei.jpeg");
  tiles = new PImage[img.height/tileSize];
  for (int i=0; i< tiles.length; i++) {
    tiles[i] = img.get(int(random(img.width-tileSize)), int(random(img.height-tileSize)), tileSize, tileSize);
  }
  imageMode(CENTER);
}

void draw() {
  pushMatrix();
  translate(width/2, height/2);

  int numSegments = 10;
  float eachAngle = TWO_PI/numSegments;
  int whichImage = (int)random(tiles.length);
  for (int i = 0; i< numSegments; i++) {
    float x = cos(eachAngle*i)*tileSize+1;
    float y = sin(eachAngle*i)*tileSize+1;
    pushMatrix();
    translate(x, y);
    rotate(eachAngle*i);
    image(tiles[whichImage], 0, 0);
    popMatrix();
  }

  popMatrix();
  noLoop();
}

void keyPressed() {
  loop();
}
````

Here is a more complex version, on which I based the simple version above: [circularImages.pde](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/master/processingExamples/pixels/circularImages/circularImages.pde)

Can we use a sequence of images for animation?

#### Electricity 

**Simple circuit using Arduino, LED, and Resistor**

The most confusing part of this lecture will be the solderless breadboard:
![](media/breadboard.jpg)
Image courtesy of
[SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)

Here is how to build the circuit

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLED_bb.png)


**Theory**

Electricity is mysterious

- We can predict what it will do quite accurately, but don't really understand
	it what is it
- Flow of electrons
- Electrons want to move from place of higher potential energy to place of lower potential energy
	- Like a rock or water falling from a height
	- Unlike a rock or water, electricity can only travel in a conductor
- AC vs. DC - very briefly, will discuss more as it comes up

What makes a circuit?

- Something to provide that difference in potential 
that will cause the electrons to want to move. 
	- Typically a battery, charger, or USB port
	- The technical term is "power supply"
	- In our case your laptop via the Arduino
		- What is the Arduino doing in this case?
- Conductors to allow the electronics to move
- Components or other things that usually convert this electrical energy 
to some other form of energy (e.g. light, sound, heat, movement)
- Optionally, switches or other sensors to control the flow of energy
	- In our circuit the resistor is controlling the brightness of the LED so that it doesn't burn out

Schematics

Here is the schematic of what you've built

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLED_schem.png)

- Important part of something, 
	without getting distracted by details (e.g. subway maps)
- What's important in an electrical schematic?
	- Where is the power coming from?
	- What other components are there in the circuit?
	- How are they connected?

**Schematics are an important way to show a circuit. You will be required to
understand and use them**

Switches

- What if we want to turn it the LED on and off?
 	- Pull out a wire
 	- That's a switch, but a pretty inconvenient one
	- Schematic symbol of switch
	- How does it work?
		- Breaks the flow of electrons by breaking the continuous path
		- Doesn't electricity (the electrons) just flow out the end of the wire?
	- The switch can go on either side. How is this possible?

Let's use a real switch

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLEDWithSwitch_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPoweringLEDWithSwitch_bb.png)

- How is this switch different from the earlier switch?
	- Schematic symbol of momentary switch
	- What was the previous "switch"?
	- Schematic symbol of toggle switch

Series and Parallel

- What if we put two switches in?
- Two different ways: series and parallel
	- Components in series have the same **current** flowing through them
	- Components in parallel have the same **voltage** across them
- No matter how many components you have in a circuit, and how they are
	connected, they will obey these principles.

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLEDWith2SwitchesParallel_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPoweringLEDWith2SwitchesParallel_bb.png)

![](media/ArduinoPowering2LEDSeries_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPowering2LEDSeries_bb.png)

- Any two components can be connected in series or parallel; not just switches
- More than two components might be in series, or parallel, or neither

Ohm's law
- I=V/R
- The math only works for linear components 
	- But the principle is the same for non-linear components 
	- **is a very important concept**:
		- For a given resistance, 
			the higher the pressure (voltage), 
				the higher the current
		- For a given voltage, the higher the "resistance", 
			the lower the current

#### Arduino finally!

Make sure everything is working

- Upload the Blink example
- Change the parameter in delay()
- Upload again and verify that the LED blinks at the new rate

What is going on?

- Code
- Circuit
- I/O pins

Let's extend this circuit to the breadboard:

![](media/ArduinoControllingLED_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoControllingLED_bb.png)

Let's add a switch

![](media/ArduinoLEDMomentarySwitch_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoLEDMomentarySwitch_bb.png)

````
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(A2, INPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {

  int switchPosition = digitalRead(A2);

  if (switchPosition == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  } else  {
    digitalWrite(8, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  }
}
````

Other things you can do:

Add another LED on a different pin

![](media/ArduinoTwoLEDs_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoTwoLEDs_bb.png)

Add another switch on a different pin

![](media/ArduinoTwoSwitches_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoTwoSwitches_bb.png)

Now write a program that will blink different patterns depending on which
switch is pressed. You can select up to four patterns. How is that possible?

#### Analog Input

Build this circuit. Try to follow the schematic and not the breadboard view:

![](media/ArduinoPhotoresistor_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPhotoresistor_bb.png)

- Analog Inputs, `analogRead()`, and (some) sensors go together
	- This only works on the six analog input pins (A0-A5)
	- Digital sensors, like a switch, have only one of two values 
	and so are more suited to a digital input

Do you see a similarity between this circuit and 
something we learned yesterday?

Analog sensors can be resistive or not. Resistive sensors all use the same
pattern: a voltage divider.
Note the similarity to the circuit we used for a switch - 
a switch is also effectively a voltage divider.

What other sensors do we have in the kit?

Which ones are resistive?

#### Analog Output

- Analog Outputs, `analogWrite()`, PWM and (some) actuators go together
	- This only works on the six PWM pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11).
	- Some actuators, like a solenoid, can be in only one of two states,
	and so are more suited to a digital output

- Not true analog voltage. PWM = Pulse Width Modulation
- Works for LEDs and motors

#### Functions that you know from Processing that are useful here:
- `map()`
- `constrain()`
- `if()`

Remember how we used `print()` in Processing to help us find problems in our 
program? You can do that in Arduino to but the function has a slightly
different name: `Serial.println()`
- Must be initialized `Serial.begin()`
- Can not concatenate strings with the `+` function
	- Instead, you need multiple calls to `Serial.println()` e.g.:

````
Serial.print("First value = ");
Serial.print(firstValue);
Serial.print(" Second value = ");
Serial.print(secondValue);
Serial.println();
````

#### In-class exercise

1. Use one of the analog sensors to select which of two LEDs lights up
1. Use one of the analog sensor to control how fast two LEDs alternate

Code we played with in class:
A few examples showing how to work with analog inputs and outputs

````
/* First, using map() and constrain() */

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

const int sensorPin = A2;
const int blueLEDPin = 6;

void loop() {

  int sensorValue = analogRead (sensorPin); // range of 0 - 1023

  int ledBrightness = map(sensorValue, 150, 620, 200, 0);

  ledBrightness = constrain(ledBrightness, 0, 200);

  // The range of my LED wasn't very good so I added this
  // to see what was going on, then I realized that my range was quite different
  Serial.print("sensorValue = ");
  Serial.print(sensorValue);
  Serial.print(" ledBrightness = ");
  Serial.print(ledBrightness);
  Serial.println();

  analogWrite(blueLEDPin, ledBrightness); // can only go 0 - 255
}
````



````
/* Aalya's solution to the first in-class exercise */

const int redPin = 6;
const int bluePin = 9;

void setup() {

}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A2);

  if (sensorValue > 400) {
    analogWrite (bluePin, 100);
    analogWrite (redPin, 0);
  } else {
    analogWrite (bluePin, 0);
    analogWrite (redPin, 100);
  }
}
````


````
/* Liyan's solution to the second exercise */
int ledPin = 3;
int ledPin2 = 5;
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the input on analog pin 0:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A2);
  // Convert the analog reading (which goes from 0 - 1023) to a voltage (0 - 5V):
  float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);
  // print out the value you read:
  Serial.println(voltage);
  analogWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(voltage * 100);
  analogWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  analogWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
  delay(voltage * 100);
  analogWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
}
````


#### Data Types

Just like in Processing, there are different data types:

````
int
float
char
boolean
````

#### Conventions: Schematics and Wire Colors

- When drawing schematics

	- All **sensors** on the **left**
	- All **inputs** on the **left** side of the Arduino 
	- All **actuators** on the **right**
	- All **outputs** on the **right** side of the Arduino 
	- There are exceptions e.g.
		- If using CAD you can't control where the pins are on Arduino
		- Some devices (e.g. the ultrasonic distance measuring sensor) that have
			both inputs and outputs

- When wiring your circuits

	- All **5V** connections should use **red** wire, 
	and don't use red for anything else
	- All **GND** connections should use **black** wire,
	and don't use black for anything else
		- If you run out of black you may either
			- Color some white cables black with a Sharpie
			- Dedicate green as an additional black, and then
			don't use green for anything else either
	- All other connections can use any other colors

#### Homework Viewing

#### Circuits

Some theory that might help you think about why circuits are they way they
are
- Important concepts:
	- Voltage 
		- Voltage is a relative quantity so it's always measured or identified
			relative to some other point (usually a common reference point such as
			"ground")
		- Can be thought of the "pressure" applied to the electrons
		- Analogous to holding a brick at a certain height above the floor. Relative
			to the floor, the brick has a certain amount of potential energy
		- Voltage exists whether or not there is a circuit
	- Resistance 
		- The resistance the electrons face as they try to get through
		components. 
		- Analogous to a traffic jam on a road
		- Conductors (wires) have zero resistance (for our purposes)
		- All components have some sort of "resistance"
		- Resistance is a property of a component and therefore
		exists whether or not there is a circuit
	- Current  
		- The rate of flow of electrons through a circuit (electrons/second)
		- Somewhat analogous to litres/hour or cars/hour
		- **Current only exists when there is a circuit**
- If you measure the voltage between any two points, the voltage will not
	change as you move to different places on the **wire**. 
		However if you cross
		a component the voltage might be different on the other side of the
		component
- If you measure current through a series of components the current will not
	change. 
		However if there are any branches some electrons might go on the
		branches and thus the current will drop.

#### Sound

**`tone()`**

- [Schematic](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ToneMelody)
- [Reference
page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/tone/)

**Notes**
- "Use of the `tone()` function will interfere with PWM output on pins 3 and 11"
	- That's not very specific. I think they mean "prevents `analogWrite()` on
		pins 3 and 11"
- The `tone()` function is *non-blocking*
- Arduino supports tabs just like in Processing
- Arduino has arrays just like in Processing

**Servo motor**

- [Schematic](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Knob)
- [Reference
page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo)


**Notes**
- Use of the servo library disables `analogWrite()` (PWM) on pins 9 and 10
- The `Servo.write()` function is *non-blocking*

#### PWM
- How do you suppose `analogWrite()` makes an LED dimmer?
- [PWM](https://www.ekwb.com/blog/what-is-pwm-and-how-does-it-work/)
- What do `analogWrite()`, `tone()` and `Servo` have in common?
- What is sound?
- How does a servo motor
	[work](https://lastminuteengineers.com/servo-motor-arduino-tutorial/)?
	

#### Blink Without `delay()`

Why do we need this? 

What problem does delay cause? 

For example, how would you
- Blink LEDs at different rates
- Blink an LED while playing a tune
- Play a tune while moving a servo motor

**Whenever we use `delay()` we can't do other things**

[Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay)

So much for blinking. What if we want to move a servo motor at the same time?

#### Theory (continued)

- Review
- Voltage does **not** change in a conductor
	- That is why we can connect things to the same node in any order
- Voltage **does** change when you go across a component
	- That is why it is **important** to make connections to the right side of a
		component!

#### Communication

File -> Examples -> Communications -> Graph

What if we want to send more than one value?

File -> Examples -> Communications -> VirtualColorMixer


### November 19 2020

#### Administration
- Record

#### Communication (continued)

Review
- **Graph** example sends one value from Arduino to Processing
- **VirtualColorMixer** sends three values, and uses the `split()` function 
in processing to split these Comma Separated Values
- Remember the principle of robust coding: Expect the unexpected 
	and provide proper handling 
- In particular, 
	sometimes The data received is invalid and so we must check for all possible
	failures e.g.
	- Empty string
		- `if (inString != null)`
	- Unexpected number of values
		- `if (colors.length >= 3)`
	- Non-numerical data
		- NaN error if we try to process mathematically 
		something that is not a number

How to check that a string contains only numerical digits 
- First, how is information sent from Arduino to Processing?
	- If we use `print()` or `println()`, on Arduino
		- The [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) code 
		for each character is sent
		- Any **numbers** are sent as a sequence of **characters**
			- E.g. the **number** `237` is sent as 
			the code for the **character** `2`, 
			then the code for the **character** `3`,
			then the code for the **character** `7`
		- This is accomplished automatically by the 
			`print()` or `println()` commands
	- In Processing, we must convert the sequence of character
		back into numbers
		- .e.g. the **characters** `2`, `3`, and `7` must be combined to form
		the **number** `237`
		- This is accomplished by the `float()` conversion function
- Now we know: To make sure that a string contains only digits,
we have to check the codes against the ASCII table before we try to 
convert them
	- Conveniently, all the digits are sequential, so we can check
	that the codes lie in the range of the code for the digit `0`
	and the code for the digit `9`
	- If we're expecting a CSV, then the comma is also a valid character,
	so we have to check for and allow that
		- Note that the ASCII code for a comma comes before the code 
		for the digit `0`, so:
			- Anything less than the code for comma is invalid
			- Anything greater than the code for `9` is invalid
			- Anything between comma and `0` is invalid

````
boolean isStringValid(String s) {
  for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++ ) {
    char c = s.charAt(i);

    if (c < ',' || c > '9' || (c > ',' && c < '0')) {
      println("found a bad char at position = " + i + " value = " + hex(c));

      myPort.clear(); // discard everything else
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
````

Insert this just after trimming the string in `serialEvent()`:

````
if (inString != null) {
    // trim off any whitespace:
    inString = trim(inString);

    if (!isStringValid(inString)) {
      myPort.clear(); // discard everything else
      return; // don't do the rest of this function
    }
````

Can we send from Processing to Arduino?
- File -> Examples -> Communications -> PhysicalPixel

What about both directions?
- File -> Examples -> Communications -> SerialCallResponseASCII

In-class exercise
- Use the response value from 
	 File -> Examples -> Communications -> SerialCallResponseASCII
	 to activate something

Arduino current limitations

Remember I=V/R 

In Arduino, V is always 5V

LEDs have relatively <strong>high</strong> "resistance", 
and so consume <strong>low</strong> current.
Motors have relatively <strong>low</strong> "resistance", 
and so consume <strong>high</strong> current


**Current flowing through any resistance causes heat (P = I^2/R)**

**Everything has resistance**

Therefore, where electricity is flowing there will be heat

**Heat causes damage**

Arduino can not protect itself from damaged caused by overheating. 
It does not <strong>limit</strong> current, 
it is <strong>damaged</strong> by too much current

The amount of heat a component can withstand before it is damaged 
is governed, to a large extent, by its size

The transistors that make up Arduino are tiny

The reason for using the separate Motor Driver is simple:

**It has much bigger transistors**

(It also makes it easier to control both direction and speed, 
but you could do that with the Arduino alone, 
it  would just be a little more complicated)

Theory

Code

````

const int ain1Pin = 13;
const int ain2Pin = 12;
const int pwmAPin = 11;

const int bin1Pin = 8;
const int bin2Pin = 9;
const int pwmBPin = 10;


void setup() {
  pinMode(ain1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ain2Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pwmAPin, OUTPUT); // not needed really
}

void loop() {
  // turn in one direction, full speed
  Serial.println("full speed");
  analogWrite(pwmAPin, 255);
  digitalWrite(ain1Pin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(ain2Pin, LOW);
  // stay here for a second
  delay(1000);

  // slow down
  Serial.println("slowing down");
  int speed = 255;
  while (speed--) {
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, speed);
    delay(20);
  }
}

**Notes**

I have added some resources for smoothing (filtering) data from noisy sensors
(all sensors are noisy to some extent) [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#smoothing-readings-from-noisy-sensors-using-filters)
